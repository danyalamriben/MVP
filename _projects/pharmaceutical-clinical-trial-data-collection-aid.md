### problem

Massively cluttered and visually noisy excel spreadsheet used by both participants and researchers to stay on testing schedules set for the study. cramming a schedule of test times that were every four minutes from 6:40 am to 1:00 am, for 16 participants was clearly not a thought out decision, but one of necessity. there was no hierarchy, no contrast between cells, and no actual names used for participants. 

Different researchers in charge of different tests all used the same sheet. Different participants with different schedules, again, used the same sheet. 

Circumstantially, participants were taking a pharmaceutical that impaired their cognition. Looking at their schedule and accurately determining where they should be headed to next was almost always a failing battle. The study ran 18 days straight, and was very exhausting at times. As a result, researchers frequently almost missed study participants or skipped over them, realizing too late that they'd just missed one box in the spreadsheet. 

### methods 

At this stage, I considered my role to be **contextual inquiry**. I would observe the issues that participants immediately began encountering, and paid attention to their solutions (a large validation of zero contrast was the fact that nearly every participant eventually wised up and highlighted their column in the schedule). 

I'd also **observe frequent issues the researchers had**. They usually fell into the category of not knowing where their participant was at the testing time, and having difficulty tracking them down within their 4 minute testing window. It was time intensive, and stressful, especially considering the testing schedule did not contain actual names, so researchers were forced to intercom "number 19, please report to XXXX," and hope that #19 recognized they meant them 

(It's difficult, especially when under any influence of sleep deprivation or pharmaceuticals, to automatically start responding to a name different from the one you've been given at birth).

**I interviewed my fellow researchers** and asked about the testing schedule. Many veteran researchers had the attitude of "it works fine, it's always been this way, you just have to pay careful attention to read the right spot". Other newer contracted researchers seemed more open about the issues being caused by the poorly designed system, and clearly encountered confusion as they tried to follow the expectations. 

### Initial Requirements

* - ease of use for researcher in charge of particular data collection activity (If I'm collecting blood, I want to be able to see **just the times relevant to my responsibilities**, without having to visually filter out the cognitive battery testing times) 
* - convenient placement of names paired with participant numbers to not rely on working memory and to easily call out and identify who is missing, who is on deck, etc. 
* - a way to keep track of progress throughout the day of testing (did we already do collection X yet?)
