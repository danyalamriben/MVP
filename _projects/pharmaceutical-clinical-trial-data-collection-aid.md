\##problem

Massively cluttered and visually noisy excel spreadsheet used by both participants and researchers to stay on testing schedules set for the study. cramming a schedule of test times that were every four minutes from 6:40 am to 1:00 am, for 16 participants was clearly not a thought out decision, but one of necessity. there was no hierarchy, no contrast between cells, and no actual names used for participants.

Different researchers in charge of different tests all used the same sheet. Different participants with different schedules, again, used the same sheet.

\##methods

At this stage, I considered my role to be **contextual inquiry**. I would observe the issues that participants immediately began encountering, and paid attention to their solutions (a large validation of zero contrast was the fact that nearly every participant eventually wised up and highlighted their column in the schedule).

I’d also **observe frequent issues the researchers had**. They usually fell into the category of not knowing where their participant was at the testing time, and having difficulty tracking them down within their 4 minute testing window. It was time intensive, and stressful, especially considering the testing schedule did not contain actual names, so researchers were forced to intercom “number 19, please report to XXXX,” and hope that #19 recognized they meant **_them_**

\**I interviewed my fellow researchers** and asked about the testing schedule. Many veteran researchers had the attitude of “it works fine, it’s always been this way, you just have to pay careful attention to read the right spot”. Other newer contracted researchers seemed more open about the issues being caused by the poorly designed system, and clearly encountered confusion as they tried to follow the expectations.

\### Initial Requirements

Ease of use for researcher in charge of specific activity (If I’m collecting blood, I want to be able to see **just the times relevant to my responsibilities**, without having to visually filter out the cognitive battery testing times)

Convenient placement of names paired with participant numbers to not rely on working memory and to easily call out and identify who is missing, who is on deck, etc.

A way to keep track of progress throughout the day of testing (did we already do collection X yet?)

\### prototyping

I created a testing schedule for myself that only contained times specific to an activity I was responsible for (since I had a few different responsibilities, I created a few schedules along the same guidelines). I used dot-gridded paper to keep information cleanly spaced and organized. I had a grey highlighter to separate columns and actually wrote times in rows using alternating pen colors so I was able to locate a particular time easily, without losing my place. I also utilized a clear overlay that allowed me to cover up testing schedules that differed for each day in the trial (each test was 3 days long, and testing frequency was different depending on what day it was in that group). Being able to only see the information relevant to that day of testing made it almost impossible to accidentally test at the wrong time.
