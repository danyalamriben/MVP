# problem

Massively cluttered and visually noisy excel spreadsheet used by both participants and researchers to stay on testing schedules set for the study. cramming a schedule of test times that were every four minutes from 6:40 am to 1:00 am, for 16 participants was clearly not a thought out decision, but one of necessity. there was no hierarchy, no contrast between cells, and no actual names used for participants. 

Different researchers in charge of different tests all used the same sheet. Different participants with different schedules, again, used the same sheet. 

Circumstantially, participants were taking a pharmaceutical that impaired their cognition. Looking at their schedule and accurately determining where they should be headed to next was almost always a failing battle. The study ran 18 days straight, and was very exhausting at times. As a result, researchers frequently almost missed study participants or skipped over them, realizing too late that they'd just missed one box in the spreadsheet.
