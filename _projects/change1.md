Humans of Columbus is a traveling dinner party bringing humans together to share ideas and collaborate.

Our mission is to redefine what it means to break bread with a stranger.
This leads into our larger vision of creating a social ecosystem where valuable exchanges thrive.
We want Columbus residents and artists to invest in making connections here that will continue to establish our city as a premier hub of creativity.
