I’ve encountered multiple people that I’ve worked with over the years that have a way of thinking.... They all respond to an idea for improving something with 

> “it works fine for me”.  

I always struggle personally to fully identify with this belief. I just realized that it might be worth finding out how people define “fine” in these instances. 

I’ve found that people who have already grown accustomed to a certain procedure or system to be less aware of it’s shortcomings. 

They don’t remember as readily the times that they made mistakes as a result of confusion. 

They see other’s failures to optimize the thing as a statement about the person, and not the thing.

I think that’s because of another thing: **the more they’ve grown used to a product whether it’s well designed or not, the more likely they are to take any criticism of the thing itself as almost a personal insult.** 

Saying “that’s how it’s always been” or “its always worked for me” or “if you think you can do it better, then you make it“ has always come across defensive.

It’s clear that the mentality of criticizing something’s design as a mental exercise or just automatic observation isn’t seen as objective by everyone. I should add that only in the context of writing this have I really called it “criticism”. 

For me, it’s really just been about blurting out ideas on how something could be better. 

“It would be nice if they made the text for the nav buttons a little more distinguished from the information on the page”

“I wish they would put the information that they know we have to care about the most in a different color so I didn’t have to scan this entire page for the info that I need to finish a transaction” 

“Can we just write which key to grab on the folder instead of having to remember this complicated system of key assignment? I wind up trying 4 different keys before figuring it out, I can’t remember the system when I’m busy and stressed” 

These things have always come from using a product and wishing there were certain improvements made. I suppose that’s a criticism, but it isn’t made from a place of being nitpicky, whiny, and a big complainer. 

People have often seen the desire for design improvements as being needy or a less capable user. _“You can’t find the information on the page? It’s right there, I never have a problem”_ 

It somehow becomes a reflection on one’s ego, as if wishing your system encouraged success more readily than confusion or failure is somehow admitting that you’re dumber than everyone else who just puts up with it without any complaints. 

I have the belief that if something isn’t intuitive to use or is just glaringly,  poorly designed, that’s **not a me-problem, it’s a human-problem.** 

I’m not that special in how I understand my world around me. It’s basic human processing, and to be honest I’m pretty technologically savvy so it might even be skewed in the other direction. **Advocating for more human centered design isn’t just on my own behalf, it’s on everyone’s behalf and interest.** 

It doesn’t mean I’m stupid, it means I’m not ignoring something out of the fear of being seen as stupid. 

I think the mentality comes from a place of not feeling entitled to asking for more. First we try to deny our basic human perceptions of things or become numb to the downsides of using a system, and then we tell ourselves that we don’t need to fix anything, _it’s fine._ 

It’s so hard to get people to step back and genuinely consider if, in a world where there would be _no negative consequences from asking for **more**_**,** what, if any, reasons would they have not to say yes? 

And to go further, what negative consequences are even in place in today’s world? What’s preventing people from admitting they would like the better product? 

Better designed, more intuitive and delightful experience, increased mental ram/energy/attention to use on other tasks, increased _PROFITS_! 

**Why do people come across as against these things?** They would benefit just as much as the person proposing an improvement. 

##### Probably because these people get sick of hearing what they think are complaints

Sick of good idea fairies

Sick of talking about things that aren’t immediately and directly actionable, not the type of people to talk about abstract ideas or things that don’t directly interest and affect them 

Uninterested in hearing you talk about idealistic improvements instead of _just fucking doing your job_ 

People who aren’t the type to talk about things just for the sake of weighing ideas with no clear outcome or goals 

People who **just don’t give a shit about this particular thing**,  they don’t get paid enough to worry about this and they have a personal life, a family, their own crap to deal with

People who **genuinely experience no friction** when using this product and do not feel that it’s design is in any way a hindrance to their task. 

**The ones who aren’t overworked and spread-thin**. 

**_The unicorns_**, who’s unique cognitive processing happen to be the perfect match for this particular design. A solution that benefits the crowd may even create a less functional approach for them. There’s always the risk, at least
