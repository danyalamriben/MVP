  The key to great experiences begins with intentional design. It's a process that is inextricably linked to robust research methodology.

  It is our responsibility as UX professionals to set our intentions on validating the design of an experience at every step of the way, as advocates of our audience, our users.

  My desire is to bring effective and delightful experiences to the world by utilizing design research methodologies in a strategic, innovative, and unprecedented manner.

  If this resonates with you, please contact me. I'm sure there's a great conversation to be had!
